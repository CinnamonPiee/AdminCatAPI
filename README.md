## Technologies

    FastAPI – for building the API.
    SQLAlchemy – ORM for database interactions.
    PostgreSQL – for data storage.
    Alembic – for database migrations.
    Docker & Docker Compose – for containerization and managing dependencies.
    Pytest – for testing the API.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kitten-exhibition-api.git
    cd kitten-exhibition-api
    ```
2. Environment setup
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Create a .env file at the root of the project and add the following:
    ```bash
    DB_HOST=YOUR_DB_HOST
    DB_PORT=YOUR_DB_PORT
    DB_USER=YOUR_DB_USER
    DB_PASS=YOUR_DB_PASS
    DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
    TEST_DB_USER=YOUR_TEST_DB_USER
    TEST_DB_PASS=YOUR_TEST_DB_PASS
    TEST_DB_HOST=YOUR_TEST_DB_HOST
    TEST_DB_PORT=YOUR_TEST_DB_PORT
    TEST_DB_NAME=YOUR_TEST_DB_NAME
    ```
5. Docker setup
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```
6. Run the containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
This will start the FastAPI app, PostgreSQL, and Alembic for database migrations.
Manual setup

If you are not using Docker, ensure PostgreSQL is running locally and you have the proper connection string set in .env. Then, you can start the app manually:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Running the Application

After successful setup, the FastAPI application will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
API Documentation

The API comes with automatic documentation generated by FastAPI and can be accessed at:

    Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
    Redoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

You can use these pages to interact with and explore the API.
